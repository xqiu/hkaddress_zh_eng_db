Make a hongkong address Chinese/English JSON file in the format of data similar to https://github.com/donma/TaiwanAddressCityAreaRoadChineseEnglishJSON

# To update

1. Download latest data from https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dpo-als_01-als . we should remove the 3d data file as it's too much.
2. use convert.py to convert to hk_data.json, which is just for chinesename/englishname translation.
